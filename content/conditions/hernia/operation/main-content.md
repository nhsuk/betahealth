You’ll need an operation to fix a hernia.

You may not need an operation straight away. Your hernia won’t get better
without surgery, but it doesn’t always get worse. You can discuss with your
doctor whether or not you need surgery. They’ll consider:

* the type of hernia you have --- some are more prone to complications
* if your hernia is causing problems, such as pain
* your health --- surgery may be a risk in some cases

## Groin hernia operation

There are two types of groin hernia operation:

### Open surgery

1. You’ll be given an injection in the spine to numb the area (local
   anaesthetic), or an injection into the vein to make you sleep during the
   operation (general anaesthetic).
1. The surgeon makes a cut (6-8cm long) over the hernia. They will push the
   hernia back into your tummy and stitch a mesh over the weak spot the hernia
   came through. This strengthens it.
1. Your skin will be stitched back together with dissolvable stitches.

### Keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery

1. You’ll be given an injection to make you sleep during the operation (general
   anaesthetic).
1. The surgeon makes 3 small cuts in your tummy. Your tummy is filled with gas
   to make space and a camera and 2 small tools are inserted into the
   cuts. Your surgeon can see what they’re doing through the camera.
1. Your surgeon will pull the hernia back into your tummy and stitch a mesh
   over the weak spot in the muscle.
1. The cuts in your skin will then be glued or stitched back together.

### Types of keyhole surgery
