## Before your operation

You may have to wait. This depends on the number of operations before you and
any emergencies.

Your nurse will help you change into a hospital gown and check things like your
blood pressure.

Your anaesthetist will talk you through your anaesthetic.

Your surgeon will ask you to sign a consent form and mark the place on your body
where they’re going to operate.

## Bringing someone with you

Someone can come with you to the ward. While you get ready for surgery and have
your operation they can wait in the waiting area or cafeteria.

## Having your anaesthetic

You’ll be taken into the anaesthetic room, where the anaesthetist and their
team will put you to sleep.

## Your operation

The operation will take 90 minutes.

## After your Operation

When your anaesthetic wears off, you’ll be looked after by a recovery nurse
who will closely monitor you.

You may feel drowsy, sick, and have some pain --- ask the nurse to give you
medicine to help.

You’ll be moved to another ward where you’ll be monitored until you can go home.

!!! warning
You’ll be going home the same day as your operation. Make sure you’ve arranged
for someone to take you home.
