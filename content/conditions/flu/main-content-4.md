## How to avoid spreading the flu

Flu is very infectious and easily spread to other people. You’re more likely to give it to others in the first 5 days.

Flu is spread by germs from coughs and sneezes which can live on hands and surfaces for 24 hours.

To reduce the risk of spreading flu:

- wash your hands often with warm water and soap
- use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
- bin used tissues as quickly as possible

### How to prevent flu

The flu vaccine reduces the risk of catching flu as well as spreading it to others.

It’s more effective to get the vaccine before the start of the flu season (December to March).
