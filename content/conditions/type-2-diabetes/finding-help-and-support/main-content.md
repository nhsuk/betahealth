## Finding help and support for type 2 diabetes

There is a lot of information and support available for type 2 diabetes.
Some of the support depends on the area you live in.

### Take a course to help you manage your diabetes

There are free education courses to help you learn more about and manage your
type 2 diabetes.

Your GP will need to refer you. You can phone your GP surgery to get a referral
letter, you don’t need to make an appointment.

### Telling DVLA you have type 2 diabetes

If you're taking insulin for your type 2 diabetes, you will need to
[tell the DVLA](https://www.gov.uk/diabetes-driving). This is because of the
risk of hypoglycaemia. You can be fined if you don’t tell DVLA.

### Support groups for type 2 diabetes

The charity Diabetes UK runs [local support groups.](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/How_we_help/Local_support_groups/)

They can help with things like managing your diabetes on a daily basis, diet,
exercise or dealing with emotional problems like depression. They’re a place to
talk and find out how others live with the condition.

### Blogs and forums about diabetes

* [Diabetes.co.uk forum](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/forum/) --- discussions about
  living with and managing diabetes

  blogs on food, eyes, work and diabetes and more
* [Diabetes Chat](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/diabetes-chat/) --- offers scheduled

### Telling others can be difficult

However, it can help for certain people to know you have diabetes:

* family can support you, especially as you will need to make changes to what you eat
* it’s important your colleagues or employer know in case of an emergency
* being diagnosed with diabetes can affect your mood --- telling your partner
  will help them understand how you feel

### Carry Medical ID in case of an emergency

Some people choose to wear a special wristband or carry something in their
wallet that says they have diabetes, in case there is a medical emergency.

Knowing you have diabetes can make a difference to the treatment you’ll be given.

Search the internet for ‘medical ID’ to find a website that sells them.
