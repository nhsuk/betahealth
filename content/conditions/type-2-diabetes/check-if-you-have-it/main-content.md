## How to tell if you have type 2 diabetes

Many people have type 2 diabetes and don’t realise. This is because symptoms
don’t necessarily make you feel unwell.

Symptoms of type 2 diabetes include:

* peeing more than usual, particularly at night
* feeling thirsty all the time
* feeling very tired
* losing weight without trying
* itching around your penis or vagina, or you keep getting thrush
* cuts or wounds that take longer to heal
* blurred vision

You’re more at risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:

* are over 40 (or 25 for South Asian people)
* have a close relative with diabetes (parent, brother or sister)
* are overweight or obese
* are of South Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or black African origin
  (even if you were born in the UK)

### When to see your GP

See your GP if you have any of the symptoms of type 2 diabetes, or you're
worried you may have a higher risk of developing it.

[Your GP can diagnose diabetes.](getting-diagnosed) You’ll need a blood test
which you may have to go to your local health center for if it can’t be done at
your GP surgery.

The earlier diabetes is diagnosed and treatment starts, the better. Treating
diabetes early reduces your risk of [other health problems.](health-problems)
