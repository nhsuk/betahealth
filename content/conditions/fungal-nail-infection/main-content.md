Fungal nail infections usually affect your toenails but you can get them on
your finger nails too.

## Treating fungal nail infections at home

Small fungal nail infections may not need medication.

You should:

* keep your feet clean and dry
* use separate clippers or scissors to cut your infected nails

If the look of your nail bothers you or it’s painful, speak to your
pharmacist. They may suggest:

* antifungal nail cream --- it can take up to 12 months to cure the infection
  and doesn’t always work
* nail softening cream --- used for 2 weeks to soften the nail so the
  infection can be scraped off

The infection is cured when you see healthy nail growing back at the base.

## Treatment from your GP

Your GP can prescribe you tablets if your infection is severe or has spread
to other nails.

You need to take tablets every day for up to 6 months.

Tablets can have side effects including:

* headaches
* itching
* loss of taste
* diarrhoea

You can’t take antifungal tablets if you’re pregnant or have certain
conditions. They can damage your liver.

Badly infected nails sometimes need to be removed. It’s a small procedure
done under local anaesthetic.

## Other treatment

Laser treatment uses laser to destroy the fungus.

You’ll have to pay for it as it’s not covered by the NHS. It can be
expensive. There’s little evidence to show it’s a long-term cure as most
studies only follow patients for three months.

## Preventing fungal nail infection

Fungal nail infections develop when your feet are constantly warm and damp.
You’re more likely to get an infection if you wear trainers for a long time
and have hot, sweaty feet.

To prevent fungal nail infection you should:

* keep your feet clean and dry
* wear clean socks every day
* don’t wear shoes that make your feet hot and sweaty
* wear flip flops in showers at the gym, pool etc
* don’t share towels
* throw out old shoes
* don’t wear other people’s shoes
