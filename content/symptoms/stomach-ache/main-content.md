## Treating stomach ache at home

Speak to your pharmacist about medicine to help with:

* feeling bloated (trapped wind)
* indigestion (burning pain or discomfort after eating)
* constipation (can’t poo)

There are also things you can do yourself to [help ease indigestion](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Indigestion/Pages/Treatment.aspx)
and [constipation.](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Constipation/Pages/Treatment.aspx)

If you have vomiting and diarrhoea with your stomach ache, it should
stop after a few days. Try to drink a lot of fluids to avoid
dehydration.

Painkillers like paracetamol can help with your stomach ache but won’t
stop any vomiting and diarrhoea.
